Final Dart tutorial app - the math quiz.

Commits from number 2 (#2) to number 7 (#7) are examples of OOP. The real project starts from commit number 9 (#9).

This app doesn't work on VSC terminal. Error: "Global evaluation requires a thread to have been loaded.".

Download the project, and run (through the Windows CMD) "main.dart" file located inside the "lib" folder.
